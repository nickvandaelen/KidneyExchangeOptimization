File Naming:

Instances differ in several ways, shown in the filenames. These filenames are formatted as follows

[NAME] - [SIZE] - [NDD_FLAG] - [Arc Weights] - [Instance_ID]

[NAME]
- "Delorme" and "Saidman" files are based on the generator found at https://wpettersson.github.io/kidney-webapp/#/generator. These mimic actual KEP instances, based on the papers
	- Improved instance generation for kidney exchange programmes, Delorme et al. 2022, Computers & Operations Research
	- Increasing the Opportunity of Live Kidney Donation by Matching for Two- and Three-Way Exchanges, Saidman et al. 2005, Transplantation
  You can read these papers for more details on the generation procedure.
- "RandomSparse" assume a uniform chance that arcs are present between any two pairs.

[SIZE]
- The total number of pairs and NDDs in the instance.

[NDD_Flag]
- Either NDD or NoNDD. Indicates whether non-directed donors are present in the instance.

[Arc Weights]
- Either "Unit", if each arc has the same value, or "Weight", in which case each transplant has a weight between 0 and 100.



File Format:
- Headers, showing the number of pairs, number of non-directed donors and total number of arcs in the instance.
- One line per pair or NDD. 
	- Format [ID] - [NDD Flag] - [Donor Blood Type] - [Patient Blood Type] - [Patient vPRA]
	- [ID]
	- [NDD Flag]: 0 if it concerns a pair, 1 if the line is an NDD.
	- [Donor Blood Type]: 0 for blood type 0, 1 for A, 2 for B, 3 for AB
	- [Patient Blood Type]: 0 for blood type 0, 1 for A, 2 for B, 3 for AB
	- [Patient vPRA]: 0 for vPRA below 0.5, 1 for vPRA between 0.5 and 0.85, 2 or vPRA above 0.85.

Note that this list is ordered such that the NDDs are always at the end of the pair/NDD list. (Patient Blood Type and Patient vPRA are given for NDDs, but are irrelevant)

(vPRA is a measure for the percentage of blood-type compatible donors that are incompatible with the patient for other reasons. The higher the vPRA, the less likely the patient is 
to be compatible).
